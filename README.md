# Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot
Obstacle Avoiding Robot is an intelligent device that can automatically sense the obstacle in front of it and avoid them by turning itself in another direction. This design allows the robot to navigate in an unknown environment by avoiding collisions, which is a primary requirement for any autonomous mobile robot. 

Introduction of Project	

The project of “Obstacle Avoidance Robot” is based on the interfacing of some components such as sensors ,motors etc. with STM32 microcontroller. Obstacle Avoiding Robot is an intelligent device that can automatically sense the obstacle in front of it and avoid them by turning itself in another direction. This design allows the robot to navigate in an unknown environment by avoiding collisions, which is a primary requirement for any autonomous mobile robot.

This project is divided in three parts: sensors, controller, and motors part. The sensor would observe an interruption and provide an input to the controller which would run the motor forward or backward or sidewise depending on which way the obstacle is detected . And the robot changes its path and avoid collision
